The MoNet project is an MTU Transformational Fund (TUTF) sponsored project conducting
research into modern networking technologies.

<h1>Project team</h1>

The project is conducted within the Department of Computer Science at the Cork 
Bishopstown campus of MTU. The co-PIs leading the project are:

<ul>
    <li> Dr. Victor Cionca. Focus on programmable wireless networks</li>
    <li> Roland Katona. Focus on network resource management, HAN.</li>
    <li> Dr. Dylan Smyth. Focus on network security and programmable networks.</li>
    <li> Dr. Jonathan Sherwin. Focus on SDN, data centre networking.</li>
    <li> Dr. Hristo Trifonov. Focus on user-space networking.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Research focus</h1>

MoNet tackles the challenges of current and future networking infrastructures in 
dealing with

<ul>
    <li> increase in content consumption, such as video, games, AR/VR, etc</li>
    <li> increase in the quality and size of consumed content, as well as tighter timing requirements</li>
    <li> increase in rural and sub-urban traffic demands</li>
    <li> increase in threats and attacks.</li>
</ul>

Content is constantly increasing in quality and size: 4K video is becoming commonplace,
with many starting to look at 8K. Framerate is also increasing to support video games
and AR/VR applications. The increase in content size is accompanied by an increase
in volume consumed and a shift to streaming models, where not only video and audio
are being streamed, but also video games, video conferences, lectures, training, etc.
The physical layer of current and future networks is increasing to provide higher
data rates, going beyond 400Gb fibre, 10's Gbps wireless with mmwave radios in 
both WiFi and 5G. However, while the end devices and access technologies are
able to generate content demands and support high data rate traffic, aggregating
this traffic all the way to the core network, processing the traffic, etc. will
place significant demands on the networking technologies.

The questions asked by the MoNet project are:

<ul>
    <li> what will the topology of future networks look like (who will be connected where, where will data be processed, etc)?</li>
    <li> considering the high data rates and traffic volumes, how will future networks be managed to provide reliable, available, timely access to content?</li>
    <li> how close can the edge of the network be to the end devices?</li>
    <li> can the network help the edge to process requests?</li>
    <li> increased network control can also lead to increased security, but sometimes it can also introduce new vulnerabilities; what are these vulnerabilities and how can they be prevented?</li>
</ul>

<h1>Testbed</h1>

Part of the contribution of the MoNet project will be developing a research testbed
to facilitate experimentation in the above topics. The testbed will emulate a fully
connected network edge, consisting of end devices and LANs interconnected through a
wireless mesh network.

The testbed, deployed in the MTU Bishopstown campus will consist of four network
segments interconnected through a high speed mmwave wireless mesh network.

Each network segment will contain

<ul>
    <li> high performance server hosting application VMs or for computational tasks</li>
    <li> 2x Home Area Networks each consisting of gateway + 2x end devices (Single Board Computer)</li>
    <li> SDN-enabled switch (in the future programmable switch)</li>
    <li> border router.</li>
</ul>

The mmwave mesh backbone will be implemented using Cambium CN v5000 distribution
nodes and it will allow several possible paths between network segments.
