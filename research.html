<h2>Acquiring accurate network state information at high data rates</h2>

Network operators need to be able to account for what happens on their networks -
for reasons of security, regulatory compliance, service-level agreements, and
troubleshooting and debugging. SDN has made networks more dynamic, but has also
made it more difficult to explain and account for events that occurred on the
network in the past. It is infeasible and undesirable to record every packet that
is transferred on a network. One challenge is to identify the essential set of
data to be recorded. This must be detailed enough to support the required purposes,
yet concise enough to lend the approach to being used on large networks. Another
challenge is to select appropriate methods to analyse the data. As well as classic
querying, there is an opportunity to apply AI.

<h2>Building robust and secure networks that can defend themselves and end devices against attacks</h2>

Computer networks are a key component of national infrastructure as they facilitate
various forms of essential communication for private citizens, businesses, public
services, and government departments. The 2021 HSE Ransomware attack, one of many
examples of a targeted attack against computer systems, demonstrated just how
reliant modern services are on computer systems. The attack against the HSE caused
essential health services to be unavailable and forced treatments for many patients
to be suspended. The complex nature of modern attacks, as well as the potential
for complex software and networks to contain vulnerabilities, makes defending a
modern network difficult. Security solutions developed on top of technology such
as SDN aims to address many network security issues, as well as protect networks
against targeted attacks such as the one against the HSE. However, SDN can itself
be vulnerable to attack. In the last few years research has found that these networks
can be attacked in ways which can impact end users of the network or the network
itself. Moreover, attacks have been developed which allow an attacker to bypass
security controls deployed in the network. While defensive security technology is
moving in the right direction, more work must be conducted to ensure the safety
and security of future networks.

<h2>Flexible and customisable network management interfaces for home gateway and end devices to best utilise the network resources</h2>

Due to the pandemic WAH (Work at Home) / SOHO (Small Office/Home Office) have
become the norm and is expected to remain common even after the situation
normalizes, as set out in Irelandâ€™s National Remote Work Strategy [4] that aims
to maximize economic, social and environmental benefits and is further
supported by the recently introduced legislation which gives employees the
right to requests to work remotely.  So, improving the
security/functionality/performance/resilience of home NWs is an important
consideration that impacts many users and organisation. ISPs use proprietary SW
on Consumer Perimeter Equipements (CPE) which suits to some, but to others it
is a constraint! They only provide a limited set of features and do not allow
the degree of control that is common in an enterprise NW environment.
Furthermore, they cannot be easily extended as they have a monolithic software
stack. So, developing new SW or experimenting is out of question and thus home
office users who have more specific needs regarding security and functionality
are forced to buy expensive devices. An alternative to buying enterprise grade
equipment is to use a custom open-source firmware which is increasingly
supported by OEM home GW devices. 

<h2>Achieving high data rates equivalent to optical fibre while being deterministic on a wireless mesh network</h2>

The network infrastructure presented above must be wireless to support both
fixed and mobile clients. Communication in mmwave spectrum bands above 60GHz
can reach data rates of 35Gbps, comparable to optical fibre. The links are
fragile, very sensitive to obstacles, even atmospheric changes and the use of a
mesh topology provides redundancy and can increase reliability. Considering the
high data rate this becomes similar to a switching fabric in a data centre. In
order to support enterprise traffic with Service Level Agreements on such
networks they require deterministic control. Management of network resources
and their allocation to user traffic must be centrally planned to achieve
optimality. The network must be able to react to failures quickly, considering
that 100ms of downtime can lose 350Mb of data. The challenge is to react
quickly but also correctly, such that other traffic is not affected. Existing
research in mmwave networks has highlighted the frailty of the links and the
significant impact of blockages and has proposed models for detecting or
predicting blockages. The concept of mmwave mesh networks is popularised by
Facebook through the Terragraph project, however that does not consider the
requirements for deterministic control, which is an open problem in mmwave
networking research.
